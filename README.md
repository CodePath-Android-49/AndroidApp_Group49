### App Description
The app allows the users to enter an anonymous chatting room with room number. Each user can only enter one chatting room at a time, and each chatting room shall not have more than 10 users. The users can stay in a chatting room for 30 mins. Users can create a new chatting room by entering an unused room number. After all members leave the room, all the data will be deleted if no new member enters.

### App Idea Evaluation
- Mobile: Mobile app allows users to easily text each other at any time. Users will be able to send audio records or photos with mobile phones.
- Story: Users will feel safe to chat anonymously here, since the app only allows a small group of people to share their secrets, and all information will eventually disappear.
- Market: Anyone who wants to share stories/opinions or ask for advice without revealing their identities can use this app.
- Habit: Users are using the app daily to communicate to others.
- Scope: The basic function will allow users to enter/create chat rooms, and send message to each other. In the future, the users will be able to save the chat they start, or delete the chat room they create.
